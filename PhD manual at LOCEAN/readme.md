# Specific informations for LOCEAN

## Lab documentation

There is already existing documentation for/by the lab.

The **welcome booklet** is currently available on the DropSU cloud storage (as of 2023-11-05). You will need a Sorbonne login, hopefully this is temporary until we get a better intranet and/or more stable documentation.

- https://dropsu.sorbonne-universite.fr/f/193630819 (in french)
If you have trouble accessing it ask to a senior PhD.

The **IT documentation** covers more technical subjects: mail, wifi, VPN, printers, etc. It is available *in french* in the intranet at http://info.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr/fr/.
This means you need either:
- to be connected by ethernet at the lab, which requires an approved machine.
- to use the proxy (see below)

Of course you can find more 'informal' information in this repository (more like folk's know-how), and if you still have questions you can open an issue here, or send a mail to the [IT team](http://info.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr/fr/support/).

## Proxy setup

You can use the proxy to access some lab resources from the outside (intranet, cloud). It also gives you access to some reviews.
You can set it up in your browser settings (for Firefox: Settings > General > Network settings > Configure how Firefox connects to the internet > Manual proxy).
You can also use an extension to quickly activate or deactivate the proxy, like [FoxyProxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/), also available for Chrome.
